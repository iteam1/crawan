### project's target

The table below give you full description about this project. Click on target's name for going to detail.

|No|Target|Brief|
|---|---|---|
|01|[user's experiences](#user's-experiences)|let the user can easily do some with the source code, and gain something special|
|02|[os system](#os-system)|`crawan` can be run on varitety of os-system|
|03|[new](#new)|`crawan` have to catch up and be able to work in the future|
|04|[easy to initialize](#easy-to-initialize)|the best structure is now not exist, let make a strategy to release some quickly and easily|

#### user 's experiences
there are a lot of level of user (also developer or coder etc.). let classify them into 3 kinds:
- **beginner:** `crawan` can give them gain some by just few command as `git clone`, `bash`.
- **advancer:** they can modify source code follow their own desires, reuse some module,etc.
- **professional:** they can contribute their ideas, make it stronger and bigger.

#### os-system
`linux`,`windows`,`mac` are 3 popular os system in the world, so building `crawan` must be orientated from the begining for these changes.

#### new
new web-browser every year, even the project's packages and dependencies release new verion every year, so building `crawan` must be orientated from the begining for these changes.

#### easy to initialize
create a main theme branch, create some branch base on that but customize the structure follow your implementation until you find the best option. it may be time-wasting but give you some quick demo
